## Download updated app
When a new version is available, we reccomend to not overwrite the old one since the output could be incompatible. We reccomend to use the new versions on new patients. 

## Version 2.01
        * Added a weight box (under GI GvHD assessment)
        * Added a text box to annotate the reason behind tratment discontinuation
        * Now it is possible to visualize the worst assessment in terms of overall GvHD scoring
